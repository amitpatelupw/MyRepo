Session management is core concept in application design. As we know HTTP is stateless protocol. To maintain user data between subsequent request, 
So far i have used asp.net in-proc session, sql server outproc session, aws sticky session. In Distributed environment, we use multiple servers to maintain the application load. For efficiently use of all the servers, we use load balancer to distribute the request based on server availability. I have used Aws ELB for load balancing.
